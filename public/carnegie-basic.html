            If you don't agree with someone and it's important to change their mind , <span class="font-weight-bold">do not try to prove them wrong . </span> Listen and feel their perspective . Only if they are heard properly, you will be heard . And if it's not important to change their mind , why bother ? Remember , winning an argument is not more important than the feelings of a person .

            <li>Never order anyone . Instead make a request with a question .</li>
            <li>Make them happy about doing the things you want them to do . Make them want to do it . </li>
            <li>Praise what you like in a person no matter how small . What you don't like will disappear without getting any attention and what you like will develop further .</li>
            <li>Praise and use the word "AND" then say "If you did that too it'd be great". Never use "BUT" in middle . </li>
            <li>Make them talk a lot . People like to talk about accomplishment, problems, expertise, childhood, family, travels etc . Listen attentively and encourage them to talk more . After that, they will do things for you .</li>
            <li>Get the person saying "Yes yes" immediately . That way it will be harder for them to say "No" later .</li>
            <li>"It will be better if that happens. What do you think? What can be done ?" This is how you plant suggestion with a question and let the idea come from them . Always let them think it's their idea .</li>
            <li>"A ('insert an adjective') person would do this . And i think you are an ('insert that adjective') person " . This is called appealing to the nobler motives . Similarly it also gives the person a reputation to live up to .</li>
            <li>Talk about your fault first and then gently tell them about a fault in them and say it's very easy to overcome it .</li>
            <li>Do something dramatic to get attention and try to dramatise your idea .</li>
            <li>Challenge them to do something you want them to do . Use "Can you do it please ?" instead of "Will you do it please ?" .</li>
